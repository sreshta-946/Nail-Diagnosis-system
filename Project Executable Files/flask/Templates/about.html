            <h2>About This Project</h2>
            <p>This project presents an AI-powered diagnostic tool that analyzes human nail images to identify early signs of various health conditions. Since nails can exhibit visible symptoms of diseases such as anemia, psoriasis, fungal infections, and systemic disorders, this tool uses deep learning—specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)—to classify nail conditions accurately.

Users can upload a nail image through a web interface, where the model processes and predicts the possible disease class based on trained image data. The goal is to support early detection, increase health awareness, and assist in preliminary screening before clinical diagnosis.</p>
